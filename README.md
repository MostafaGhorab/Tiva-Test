# Tiva Test #
---
## Introduction ##
This repository is a testbed for code that is to be used with Texas Instruments' [Tiva Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl). In this README, I try to use the Blink project as the example for most of the instructions. Many of the programs will have minor functionality changes with commits, so go through the file history to see different things being done. This project is a work in progress...

## Installation and Setup##
Since I develop on a Mac, here's what I did to get everything working properly:

1. Install Xcode and Xcode command line tools
2. Install Macports
3. Using Macports, install arm-none-eabi-gcc and libusb
4. Install [lm4tools](https://github.com/utzig/lm4tools)
5. Download [TivaWare](http://www.ti.com/tool/sw-tm4c) from Texas Instruments. It will probably be an exe file. Extract it and move the TivaWare folder to wherever you would like to keep it. `cd` into the folder and run `make`. This should be enough to get TivaWare fully compiled on a Mac.
6. Test everything:
	1. `cd` into the TivaWare folder
	2. Once in the TivaWare folder, `cd` to `examples/boards/ek-tm4c123gxl/blinky/gcc/`
	3. Ensure the Launchpad switch is set to "Debug"
	4. Plug in the Launchpad
	5. Run `lm4flash blinky.bin`. The built-in LED should start blinking

## Compiling ##
The last three lines of the Makefile from [this](https://github.com/madvoid/Tiva-Test/commit/182c6fb441e81f4dc0d1d8470427f55eae63c145) commit show the commands that I use to compile code and upload it to the Launchpad. You will need to change the file names to whatever you are using, and change the path after the `-I` flag to wherever your TivaWare base folder is located. I gathered all of these flags by a combination of [this](http://recursive-labs.com/blog/2012/10/28/stellaris-launchpad-gnu-linux-getting-started/) tutorial and examining the flags from the makefiles included with TivaWare. The files `startup_gcc.c` and `****.ld` were taken directly from the TivaWare examples. These files may not be the same for each project. For example, the `startup_gcc.c` file differs between the `print` project and the `echo` project, even though they are very similar.

Alternatively, you could just run the makefile to compile the code. As an alternative to running lm4flash, `make upload` will upload the binary application file to the Launchpad.

Due to my inability to write proper makefiles, for any `driverlib` files that are used in the code, the corresponding `.o` file must be manually added to the Makefile's linker flags. In addition, any `.c` files used from the TivaWare `utils` folder must be added manually. See the makefiles for examples.

## Project Descriptions ##
*	**Blink** - Blinks an LED on and off
*	**Print** - Prints to COM port and notifies user of LED status changes
*	**Echo** - Repeats user-entered serial input back to user
*	**Timers** - Blinks LEDs based on timer interrupts
